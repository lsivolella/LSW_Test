  sentences:
  - So, how do you like them? Pretty good uh?
  - You don't seem to have any money to buy my products, that's too unfortunate!
  - Maybe you should try to find some lost change on the streets. People often drop
    it or throw it away without noticing...
  - You will know when you find some change. Just click with your mouse where you
    think it is and you will be rewarded.
